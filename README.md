# Larrys_Shoppe
Capstone project for Associate of Arts and Science - AAS, Computer Programming

This is a web based solution for daily record keeping and reporting for a fictitious sartorial shop. 
Using PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and XAMPP, I developed web forms and reports to replace the companies paper based record system.
